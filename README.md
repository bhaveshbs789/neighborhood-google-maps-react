# Front End NanoDegree Final project - Neighborhood Map

NOTE : This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>

## Overview

The project uses `google-maps-react` module to work with the Google Maps API.<br>
The initial data is hardcoded :dart: and is a list of venues of a few Biryani restaurants in Hyderabad :smiley: .

`FourSquare` API used for the Project along with React to load images and get details of some venues.<br>
Its simple to use this API and you can use it by having an account at [FourSquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) :point_left:

## Get Started

To start with this App :

* Clone the app `git clone https://github.com/bhaveshbs789/neighborhood-google-maps-react.git`.
* Navigate to the folder where it was cloned (`neighborhood-google-maps-react` here).
* Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies .
* Run `npm install @material-ui/core` to install material UI.
* Finally to start the application in development mode run `npm start`.
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### Note : The default service Worker is used which comes with the google-maps-react module

## Usage

The map shows a initial markers for Biryani restaurants in hyderabad.<br>
To know more info about any of them click on the icon and it would display the address and a image (if available :grin:) from FourSquare.<br>

There is one more method to filter the restaurant List.<br>
On the top left of the screen there would be a ##`Check Out!!` button which would bring up a list of the restaurants and you can look for any one of them by clicking on it from the list menu or filter it by input text. <br>
Clicking either way should show basic info about the restaurant.
